1. What fundraising for a play could succeed?

We conducted an anlysis on a spreadsheet that contained data on fundraising for theater like plays, documentaries, musicals and so forth. First, a cleanup of the data was neccessary to be done in order to make the data easily readable and ripe for analysis. For example, we converted the unix timestamps to regular dates while focusing on years, filtered the data to find out about successful, failed and canceled fundraising and calculated the percetages for them. We found challenges and tips for success in fundraising by organizing and anlayzing the data which will be described in detail. 

2. Purpose:

The purpose of this analysis was to help Louise plan and structure her fundraisings in the future in a way that increases the likelihood of her success.


3. Analysis and Challenges:

We used pivot tables, graphics such as charts, and formulas to conduct our analysis. The challenging part was writing the formula to find out the number of successful, failed and canceled fundraising campaigns within different ranges of dollar amounts. I had to write four criteria in a "countifs" formula which was long and time consuming. It took me several hours of research to figure it out. 



4. Results:

    a. There are two major findings for Theater Outcomes based on launch date:
            1. The months of May-July are the best months for fundraising to succeed. It could be because of the summer break.
            2. The winter months (November-January) are not the best months for fundraising for plays. 

    b. Conlcusion about Outcomes based on goals: 
            1. Fundraising campaigns that had goals $1-$5,000 were 76 percent of the time successful, while campaigns that aimed to raise more than $25,000 had very few chances to succeed. 
            2. Campaigns that aimed to raise less than $5,000 had on average the most successful results. 

5. Limitations in the dataset:

Although this dataset is comprehensive and gives enough information for thorough analyses, it had few limitations too. For example there is no information about the people who contributed or pledged money to the campaigns. Some information about the demographic of the donors could make our analysis even more robust. Another issue of the lack of the genre of the theater which could help further in the analysis. 

6. Possible graphs/datasets that could be created from this spreasheet:
    a. Amount pledged by each country. For example we could find out which country has the tendency to donate higher amounts?
    b. We can create a table from this dataset to find out which currency has been donated more or less. 
There are many more potential tables that could be created from this dataset depending on the questions at hand.
